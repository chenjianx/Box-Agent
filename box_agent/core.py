"""Shared agent execution core.

This module contains the **single source of truth** for the agent loop.
It yields structured ``AgentEvent`` objects via an ``AsyncGenerator``.
CLI, ACP, and any future consumer all drive the same generator.

No ``print()`` or ``input()`` calls live here — all I/O is delegated
to the consumer through the event stream.

    """Execute the agent loop, yielding structured events.

    This is the single source of truth for the agent execution loop.
    It does **not** print anything to stdout.  Consumers (CLI, ACP,
    JSON-RPC) decide how to render each event.

    Args:
        llm: LLM client (must have an async ``generate()`` method).
        messages: Message history (mutated in-place).
        tools: ``{name: Tool}`` dict.
        max_steps: Maximum LLM call iterations.
        tool_limits: Typed product limits for search, wrap-up, and child workflows.
        max_tool_calls: Optional hard cap across all tool executions in this loop.
        web_search_total_limit: Optional per-turn web search override.
        token_limit: Token threshold for triggering summarization.
        is_cancelled: Optional callable — return ``True`` to stop.
        logger: Optional ``AgentLogger`` for file-based logging.
        workspace_dir: Workspace directory for artifact detection.
        permission_negotiator: Optional negotiator (has async
            ``negotiate(permission_request)`` method) for in-band
            permission escalation.  When present, denied tool calls
            with ``permission_request`` are negotiated with the host
            and retried on grant.  When absent, ``PermissionRequestEvent``
            is yielded for backward compatibility.
        hooks: Optional list of lifecycle hook objects.  Each hook may
            implement any subset of the ``BaseHook`` interface.  Hooks
            are called at key lifecycle points (step start/end, tool
            start/result, done, error).  Loaded identically by CLI
            and ACP from ``config.yaml``.
        memory_manager: Optional ``MemoryManager`` instance for conservative
            prompt-level context memory auto matching.
        memory_extractor: Optional ``MemoryExtractor`` instance for
        lifecycle-triggered memory extraction.  When present,
        extraction is attempted before context compression and
        every N steps.
        memory_turn_id: Optional caller-owned turn id to stamp on
            lifecycle-triggered memory extraction entries.
        inject_queue: Optional queue for in-stream message injection.
            When present, queued user messages are drained at each
            step boundary and appended to the conversation before
            the next LLM call.
        require_plan_approval: If True, the loop must publish a plan and
            stop before executing non-plan tools unless ``plan_approval``
            carries an approved decision.
        plan_approval: Host-supplied decision metadata for a previously
            published plan.
        plan_start_text: Optional host-sanitized latest user request for
            plan-start detection. When omitted, the latest user message is used.
        pause_after_plan_write: If True, an organic ``plan_write`` call also
            becomes an approval boundary: the plan is published with pending
            approval and the turn ends before sibling or later tools execute.
        parallel_tool_timeout_seconds: Wall-clock cap for one batch of
            parallel_safe tool calls. When exceeded, completed results are kept
            and unfinished calls receive synthetic timeout failures so the
            parent turn can continue.
        artifact_detection_enabled: If False, skip output-directory artifact
            snapshotting and detection for sessions that edit an existing
            project tree directly.
        truncation_continuation_enabled: If True (default), re-prompt the
            model once when a reply ends mid-sentence while the provider
            reported a normal finish, so the answer completes in the same
            message. See ``loop_guards.looks_like_truncated_output``.
        max_truncation_continuations: Per-turn cap on truncation
            continuations (loop guard against repeated false positives).
        artifact_root_dir: Optional explicit artifact directory supplied by a
            host session. Defaults to ``{workspace_dir}/output``.
        cache_fingerprint_context: Optional stable metadata to include with
            cache-sensitive request fingerprints, such as selected skill names.
        cache_fingerprint_sink: Optional callback that receives each fingerprint
            before the LLM request, for hosts that do not use ``AgentLogger``.
        workflow_policy: Optional host-neutral workflow hooks composed by
            ``box_agent.runtime``. The kernel never selects a concrete workflow.
        current_turn_text: Optional host-sanitized latest user request used to
            gate tools that access the user's active browser tab. When omitted,
            the latest user message is used.
        context_resource_ledger: Optional caller-owned ledger. Agent sessions
            pass a persistent instance; direct and child loops get a local one.
        context_resource_dedup_enabled: Disable the first-batch resource-history
            optimization without changing visible tool execution.
        tool_result_storage: Optional caller-owned oversized-result state. Agent
            sessions pass one persistent instance so fresh-ID decisions remain
            stable across turns.
