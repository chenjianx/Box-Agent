  - Operating system
  - Versions of relevant dependencies

### Suggesting New Features

If you have an idea for a new feature, please create an Issue first to discuss it:

- Describe the purpose and value of the feature.
- Explain the intended use case.
- Provide a design proposal if possible.

### Submitting Code

#### Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raccoon-Office/Box-Agent box-agent
   cd box-agent
   ```

3. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

5. Run a quick local check:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/ -q
   ```

6. Start the development CLI when you need a manual smoke test:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m box_agent.cli
   ```

#### Team Collaboration Baseline

- Prefer small PRs that change one behavior or one subsystem.
- Follow the [layered architecture and ownership rules](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Shared behavior does not automatically belong in `core.py`: prefer a capability/policy module behind the public contracts, and keep CLI/ACP code as adapters.
- Before changing code paths, use `.understand-anything/` as the first navigation aid when it is available, then verify the path with source reads, `rg`, tests, logs, or runtime probes. See the [code map guide](docs/UNDERSTAND_ANYTHING.md) for scope and refresh steps.
- Keep the shared Understand Anything refresh baseline and configuration in Git (`knowledge-graph.json`, `meta.json`, `fingerprints.json`, `.understandignore`, and `config.json` under `.understand-anything/`). Regenerate and review the graph, metadata, and fingerprints together when architecture boundaries or the guided tour change. Do not commit `last-run-summary.json`, intermediate, trash, dashboard tokens, or cache files.
- Do not include local credentials or user config. `config.yaml`, `mcp.json`, logs, and `workspace/` are local runtime files.
- If a change affects officev3 or any packaged runtime, say whether you verified only source behavior or also rebuilt/installed/probed the runtime artifact.

#### Ownership Boundaries

- `box_agent/core.py` is a changeable but low-churn kernel owned by the core team. Product and capability modules must use `Agent.run_events()` or the explicit shared APIs; they must not import the Core implementation directly.
- Agent-loop invariants, event semantics, scheduling, cancellation, tool-call closure, and security enforcement points belong to the stable kernel/contracts. Core changes require a core-maintainer review.
- Reusable tools, skills, providers, storage, and workflow policy belong in the capability layer unless they require a new host-neutral kernel contract. Put stateful workflows in `box_agent/workflows/`, implement `WorkflowPolicy`, and compose them through `runtime.py` instead of importing them from Core.
- CLI code should handle terminal interaction, rendering, slash commands, and local prompts. It should not fork core behavior that ACP also needs.
- ACP code should translate shared events into ACP protocol updates and host extension methods. Keep stdout protocol-clean; diagnostics belong on stderr or structured logs.
- Provider-specific wire behavior belongs in `box_agent/llm/`; do not spread provider assumptions into tools, skills, CLI, or ACP.
- Tool behavior belongs in `box_agent/tools/` and should return structured `ToolResult` data. Add direct regression tests for new tool semantics.
- Built-in skill loading is controlled by `box_agent/skill_loader.py`, `box_agent/skills/`, and `box_agent/skills/_manifest.json`. When built-in skills change, regenerate the manifest before review.
- PPT/document capabilities are skill-driven unless there is an explicit core contract change. PPT intent routing, checkpoints, and tool policy belong in `box_agent/completion.py` and `box_agent/workflows/presentation_*`; do not add hidden PPT-specific modes to the core loop or `loop_guards.py`.
- Packaged runtime behavior is not proven by source edits alone. If officev3 or a standalone runtime depends on the change, document the runtime rebuild/install/probe status.

#### TPR Pull Request Standard

Every non-trivial PR should be reviewable through TPR:

- **Task**: what behavior changed, why, affected entry points, and what is out of scope.
- **Proof**: exact commands, tests, probes, screenshots, logs, regenerated manifests, or runtime checks.
- **Risk**: compatibility, packaging/runtime impact, migration, config/secrets, rollback plan, and cross-repository follow-up.

The PR must also identify affected architecture layers and record whether
target-branch changes after the merge base were considered. The expanded
[Pull Request Review Standard](docs/PR_REVIEW_STANDARD.md) defines the review
gates used for non-trivial changes.

#### Development Process

1. **Write Code**
   - Follow the project's code style (see the [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)).
   - Add necessary comments and docstrings.
   - Keep your code clean and concise.

2. **Add Tests**
   - Add test cases for new features.
   - Ensure all tests pass:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/ -v
     ```

3. **Update Documentation**
   - If you add a new feature, update the README or relevant documentation.
   - Keep documentation in sync with your code.

4. **Commit Changes**
   - Use clear commit messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat(tools): Add new file search tool"
     # or
     git commit -m "fix(agent): Fix error handling for tool calls"
     ```
   
   - Commit message format:
     - `feat`: A new feature
     - `fix`: A bug fix
     - `docs`: Documentation updates
     - `style`: Code style adjustments
     - `refactor`: Code refactoring
     - `test`: Test-related changes
     - `chore`: Build or auxiliary tools

5. **Rebase onto the Latest `main`**
   - Before opening or updating a Pull Request, rebase your branch onto the
     latest `main` from the base repository. Do not merge `main` into your
     feature branch.
   - For a fork-based contribution, add the base repository as `upstream` once,
     then rebase:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/Raccoon-Office/Box-Agent.git  # once
     git fetch upstream main
     git rebase upstream/main
     ```
   - Direct collaborators may use `origin/main` instead. If the branch was
     already pushed, coordinate before rewriting a shared branch and update it
     with `git push --force-with-lease`; never use `--force`.

6. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Create a Pull Request on GitHub.
   - Clearly describe your changes.
   - Reference any related Issues if applicable.

#### Pull Request Checklist

### Code Review

All Pull Requests will be reviewed. Maintainers use the detailed
[Maintainer Review Guide](docs/REVIEW_GUIDE.md) for review order, blockers, and
proof expectations:

- For the full PR gate, severity, and verdict contract, also read the
  [Pull Request Review Standard](docs/PR_REVIEW_STANDARD.md).

- Review starts from the TPR evidence. Missing proof is treated as incomplete work, not as a reviewer task.
- Reviewers should check behavior, ownership boundaries, tests, packaging/runtime implications, and documentation before style details.
- For shared behavior, reviewers should confirm the change is not implemented separately in CLI and ACP unless there is a clear entry-point-specific reason.
- For skill changes, reviewers should check `box_agent/skills/_manifest.json` and any officev3 recommendation-card impact.
- For packaged runtime changes, reviewers should check whether source tests are enough or a runtime rebuild/install/probe is required.
- Once approved, the PR will be merged into the main branch.

## Code Style Guide

### Python Code Style

Follow PEP 8 and the Google Python Style Guide:

```python
# Good example ✅
class MyClass:
    """A brief description of the class.
    
    A more detailed description...
    """
    
    def my_method(self, param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> str:
        """A brief description of the method.
        
        Args:
            param1: Description of parameter 1.
            param2: Description of parameter 2.
        
        Returns:
            Description of the return value.
        """
        pass

# Bad example ❌
class myclass:  # Class names should be PascalCase
    def MyMethod(self,param1,param2=10):  # Method names should be snake_case
        pass  # Missing docstring
```

### Type Hinting

Use Python type hints:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any

async def process_messages(
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    max_tokens: Optional[int] = None
) -> str:
    """Process a list of messages."""
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features.
- Keep tests simple and clear.
- Ensure tests cover critical paths.

```python
import pytest
from box_agent.tools.my_tool import MyTool

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_tool():
    """Test the custom tool."""
    tool = MyTool()
    result = await tool.execute(param="test")
    assert result.success
    assert "expected" in result.content
```
