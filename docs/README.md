# Box-Agent Documentation

Use this index to find the current source-of-truth document for each subsystem.
The root [README](../README.md) and [中文 README](../README_CN.md) are the
product quick start; files here cover implementation, deployment, and host
contracts.

## ACP host integration

Start with the [ACP integration index](INTEGRATION.md), then open the specific
wire contract:

- [Host progress events](integration/host-progress-events.md): sub-agent, plan,
  todo, goal, and other structured tool activity.
- [Artifact protocol](ARTIFACT_PROTOCOL.md): generated file discovery and host
  rendering.
- [Action Hint protocol](ACTION_HINT_PROTOCOL.md): model-generated navigation
  hints.
- [Environment Context protocol](ENV_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL.md): host facts injected
  into a session.
- [Filesystem Policy protocol](FILESYSTEM_POLICY_PROTOCOL.md): workspace roots,
  extra allowed directories, and permission negotiation.
- [Memory Match protocol](MEMORY_MATCH_PROTOCOL.md): explicit and automatic
  recall shown to hosts.
- [Memory Promotion protocol](MEMORY_PROPOSAL_PROTOCOL.md): proposal push, list,
  and apply flows.
- [User Decision protocol](USER_DECISION_PROTOCOL.md) / [用户决策协议](USER_DECISION_PROTOCOL_CN.md):
  public Skill decision cards, runtime-bounded defaults, and same-session resume.

## Documentation maintenance

- Verify behavior against current source and focused tests; the
  `.understand-anything/` graph is navigation help, not the source of truth.
- Keep English/Chinese pairs synchronized in the same change.
- Do not update [Release State](RELEASE_STATE.md) as if development code were
  shipped. Published versions need a real tag, package/release links, artifacts,
  and SHA256 values.
- Changes used by officev3 or another packaged host need runtime
  rebuild/install/probe evidence in addition to source tests.
